## Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## First create a directory called "mydata"
if(!dir.exists("./mydata")){dir.create("./mydata")}


## Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 




## Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set




## Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 




## From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
